# ðŸ‘· Rebater

A desktop application to automate Fuse Alliance's Rebate process for its suppliers.

Each quarter, Fuse Alliance gets a stream of expense report files from the various suppliers under the alliance. They come in many different formats, and styles. Inside each file contains data for rebate processing: how many purchases were made between different suppliers under that alliance, the amount, and the expected rebates they get.

Given the large amount of inconsistent data formats, doing the process manually takes upwards of 80 hours, per quarter. This application attempts to make the process faster, and simpler.
